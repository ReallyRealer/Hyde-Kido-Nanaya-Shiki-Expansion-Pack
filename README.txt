Thanks for downloading my random mod!

Anyways to install it you straight up just copy every file from this folder into the root of MBTL.
Then boot up the game and it should work!

Hyde - Literally just this https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/Under_Night_In-Birth/UNI2/Hyde (his Arc Drive is 41236+D like UNi though and Veil Bringer is 236BC like UNi2 as well) 

6BC (5FF from UNi)
2BC (2FF from UNi2)
4BC (Smart Steer from UNi2)
j4BC (Smart Steer from UNi2 except this time it's in the air)
j214x series also exists

Nanaya:

J0202 (fastfall by double tapping down in midair)
623A + A (cancels 623A into a fastfall)
623B + B (cancels 623B into a upwards flip)
0202x is just his tp series
J2B (kick dive)
214x is a new series (mainly just reused his boss rush 0202D adds but as separate moves)
2BC is a TP stance that can be canceled into A or B (holding backwards will make him go the opposite direction) you can also cancel into A twice or A into B
4BC is just Tohno Shiki's regular one since it was already fine
6BC is a special version of his regular 236x series where he'll uppercut upon hit and if you press B upon hitting you'll be able to cancel into his upwards TP
3BC is Tohno Shiki's except this time upon successful hit he'll cancel into his flip automatically
