# Hyde Kido + Nanaya Shiki Expansion Pack
My mod that features a (UNi2) Hyde port & a custom Nanaya that has alternated versions of Tohno's moves to replicate MBAACC Nanaya


Atm this is only my second FB project

EX Tohno is selectable by pressing down while on Nanaya or up while on P.Ciel

**CREDITS:** MBTL GX made by U4ick (I reused & edited some of its assets for Nanaya's Arc Drive & Last Arc)

and [Fatih120 ](https://github.com/Fatih120) for making the Nanaya idle sprite edit

**PLEASE DOWNLOAD FROM THE [RELEASES TAB](https://github.com/ReallyRealer/Hyde-Kido-Nanaya-Shiki-Expansion-Pack/releases) AS MAIN ISN'T UPDATED TO V2 YET**

# Movesets
**Hyde** - Literally just [this](https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/Under_Night_In-Birth/UNI2/Hyde#Move_List) (his Arc Drive is 41236+D like UNi though and Veil Bringer is 236BC like UNi2 as well)

I forgor that he has moon skills lol
- 6BC (5FF from UNi)
- 2BC (2FF from UNi2)
- 4BC (Smart Steer from UNi2)
- j4BC (Smart Steer from UNi2 except this time it's in the air)
- j214x series also exists


**Nanaya** 
- J0202 (fastfall by double tapping down in midair)
- 623A + A (cancels 623A into a fastfall)
- 623B + B (cancels 623B into a upwards flip)
- 0202x is just his tp series
- J2B (kick dive)
- 214x is a new series (mainly just reused his boss rush 0202D adds but as separate moves)
- 2BC is a TP stance that can be canceled into A or B (holding backwards will make him go the opposite direction) you can also cancel into A twice or A into B
- 4BC is just Tohno Shiki's regular one since it was already fine
- 6BC is a special version of his regular 236x series where he'll uppercut upon hit and if you press B upon hitting you'll be able to cancel into his upwards TP
- 3BC is Tohno Shiki's except this time upon successful hit he'll cancel into his flip automatically

**EX Tohno** 
- 236x (minus EX) is now a rekka series where mashing A or B leads to different enders (A launches them away and B is an uppercut)
- 236EX is basically MBAACC Tohno except he'll pause to catch his knife, pressing C right before it ends will make him do a follow-up attack that costs no meter at all
- J0202x new aerial series based on MBAACC
- Every 623/J236 move is alternated
- New 0202x series
- J0202D is a downwards TP
- J0202BC (2BC in midair) is J0202D except way faster
- MBAACC Tohno's standing B add is back (press B again after 5B it can also be increased if you hold it)
- New Arc Drive
- New Last Arc
