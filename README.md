# Hyde Kido + Nanaya Shiki Expansion Pack
My mod that features a (UNi2) Hyde port, a custom Nanaya that has alternated versions of Tohno's moves to replicate MBAACC Nanaya, a custom Tohno kit, and a (UNi2) Linne port


Atm this is only my second FB project

EX Tohno is selectable by pressing down while on Nanaya or up while on P.Ciel

# Movesets
**ALL COMMANDS ARE NOW VISIBLE INGAME AS OF V3**

**Hyde** - Literally just [this](https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/Under_Night_In-Birth/UNI2/Hyde#Move_List) (his Arc Drive is 41236+D like UNi though and Veil Bringer is 236BC like UNi2 as well)

I forgor that he has moon skills lol
- 6BC (5FF from UNi)
- 2BC (2FF from UNi2)
- 4BC (Smart Steer from UNi2)
- j4BC (Smart Steer from UNi2 except this time it's in the air)
- j214x series also exists


**Nanaya** 
- J0202 (fastfall by double tapping down in midair)
- 623A + A (cancels 623A into a fastfall)
- 623B + B (cancels 623B into a upwards flip)
- 0202x is just his tp series
- J2B (dive kick)
- 214x is a new series (mainly just reused his boss rush 0202D adds but as separate moves)
- 2BC is a TP stance that can be canceled into A or B (holding backwards will make him go the opposite direction) you can also cancel into A twice or A into B
- 4BC is just Tohno Shiki's regular one since it was already fine
- 6BC is a special version of his regular 236x series where he'll uppercut upon hit and if you press B upon hitting you'll be able to cancel into his upwards TP
- 3BC is Tohno Shiki's except this time upon successful hit he'll cancel into his flip automatically
- J214A (From H-Nanaya in MBAACC)
- J214B (From H-Nanaya in MBAACC)
- J214EX (From H-Nanaya in MBAACC)
- J214BC (J214EX but weaker and has armor, can be jump cancelable anytime after the second kick)
- New Arc Drive with two versions (Regular & HEAT)
- Regular comes out faster but is weaker, blockable, and has less overall range
- HEAT comes out slower but is stronger, unblockable, has more range, and creates a clone

**EX Tohno** 
- 236x (minus EX) is now a rekka series where mashing A or B leads to different enders (A launches them away and B is an uppercut)
- 236EX is basically MBAACC Tohno except he'll pause to catch his knife, pressing C right before it ends will make him do a follow-up attack that costs no meter at all
- J0202x new aerial series based on MBAACC
- Every 623/J236 move is alternated
- 623EX can be jump canceled on either the first or second flip
- New 0202x series
- J0202D is a downwards TP
- J0202BC (2BC in midair) is J0202D except way faster
- MBAACC Tohno's standing B add is back (press B again after 5B it can also be increased if you hold it)
- 214x adds reworked (214EX is more similar to MBAACC except doesn't force a wall bounce unless near)
- 214EX can be canceled into feint by pressing D or doing the feint input
- 421x new grounded series based on F-Tohno's 0202x in MBAACC
- New Arc Drive
- New Last Arc

**Linne** - Literally just [this](https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/Under_Night_In-Birth/UNI2/Linne) (She can use her arc drive via 236+BC or 41236+D, also to do rapid beat instead of C_C follw up, hold upwards then press C again)

- 6BC, only usuable after 236x (236x --> 6FF from UNi2)
- Dash BC (Dash FF from UNi2)

# How to enable/disable Hyde announcer

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a65a0b9-52cd-4c8c-b067-73585b4f9155)

1. Open the "se" folder
2. Next open the "normal_se" folder
3. Then open the "announce" folder
4. Finally just rename the "system" folder to like anything else (ex. "hyd_system")

To re-enable just change it back to "system" (Note that enabling/disabling requires you to relaunch the game)

# How to use alternate BGM files

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/197c364f-050f-4262-b156-1683851a58f8)

Lets say you wanted to use V1 BGM..

1. Open the "Bgm" folder
2. Rename "bgm - v1 + new.txt" to just "bgm.txt" (beforehand remember to rename, move, or delete the current "bgm.txt")
3. Relaunch game

Basically same process if you want to switch to v2 alt bgm
